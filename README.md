# CS7CS3 Advanced Software Engineering: Group 2

## Description

This application has been developed by Group 2 as part of the M.Sc in Computer Science - Advanced Software Engineering module at Trinity College Dublin. It focuses on building smart, sustainable, and data-driven solutions to support sustainable urban living in Dublin.

The system is divided into two main components:

- **Frontend** – A Tauri/React-based application for user interaction.
- **Backend** – A RESTful API built with Node.js and Express for handling data, logic, and database operations.

Each component has its own README for setup instructions and technical details.
